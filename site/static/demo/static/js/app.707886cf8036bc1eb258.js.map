(2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n         *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n         *\n         * So what to do?  The is the best:\n         *\n         *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n         *\n         * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n         * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n         *\n         *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n         *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n         *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n         *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n         *\n         * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n         * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n         * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n         * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n         * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n         * linear speed or acceleration.\n         *\n         * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n         *\n         *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n         *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n         *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n         *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n         *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n         *\n         *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n         *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n         *     pixels!\n         *\n         *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n         *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n         *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n         *\n         * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n         *\n         *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n         *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n         *\n         *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n         *\n         *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n         *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n         *     you know.\n         *\n         * Implementation info:\n         *\n         * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n         * average mouse:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *\n         * On the trackpad:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *\n         * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n         * also missing delta values.\n         *\n         * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n         *\n         * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n         *\n         * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n         * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.

role属性: 可以是cancel(关闭)/destructive(警告/删除)/null, destructive在IOS下有用, 样式为红色字体\n * - icon属性: 具体参考Icon组件的写法\n *\n * ### 注意点\n *\n * - 组件挂载点在App组件中定义, 是在业务页面之上, 且开启loading/toast都不会遮盖他.\n * - 弹出层默认都是根据路由相应的, 当路由切换则弹层自动关闭, 这部分可用`dismissOnPageChange`修改.\n * - 可以点击背景关闭组件, 这个在`enableBackdropDismiss`中定义.\n * - 建议在关闭动画Promise之后处理请他业务, 这样动画会顺滑一些, 这里监听动画的关闭不是使用setTimeout, 而是监听transitionEnd事件, 因此更可靠.\n *\n * @demo #/action-sheet\n * @example\n *\n * import { ActionSheet } from 'vimo'\n *\n * ActionSheet.present({\n *  title: '请选择操作',\n *  subTitle: '注意，选择后不能撤销！',\n *  cssClass: 'ActionSheetCssClass1 ActionSheetCssClass2',\n *  enableBackdropDismiss: true,\n *  buttons: [\n *    {\n *      text: '删除',\n *      role: 'destructive',\n *      icon: 'trash',\n *      cssClass: '  DestructiveBtnCssClass1 DestructiveBtnCssClass2 ',\n *      handler: () => {\n *        console.log('Destructive clicked');\n *      }\n *    },\n *    {\n *      text: '分享',\n *      icon: 'share',\n *      handler: () => {\n *        console.log('Archive1 clicked');\n *      }\n *    },\n *    {\n *      text: '播放',\n *      icon: 'play',\n *      handler: () => {\n *        console.log('Archive4 clicked');\n *      }\n *    },\n *    {\n *      text: '取消',\n *      role: 'cancel',\n *      icon: 'close',\n *      handler: () => {\n *        ActionSheet.dismiss().then((data) => {\n *          console.debug('promise的退出方式')\n *        });\n *      }\n *    }\n *  ]\n * })\n *\n */\n\n/**\n * @function present\n * @description\n * 开启ActionSheet组件, 当开启动画过度完毕时触发 `Promise` 的 `resolve` 。\n * @param {object} options -

inputs属性内type的属性的填值能改变弹出层的展现形式, 比如: input/checkbox/radio等三种形式.\n * - 上述的三种形式一次只能选择一种, 这个是规定定死的.\n * - 关于input的type类型: text/tel/number/email -> 对应的其余属性可以是: type/name/placeholder/value.\n * - 关于input的type类型: checkbox/radio -> 对应的其余属性可以是: type/value/label/checked/disabled.\n * - 以上如果混用是达不到效果的, 这个是Alert组件的使用约定.\n *\n *\n * ### 使用注意\n *\n * - 建议在关闭弹出层动画后在处理关闭事项, 比如跳转/再次弹出提示等\n * - 弹层组件全部对路由跳转相应, 比如路由切换则弹层自动关闭, 这个可以通过`dismissOnPageChange`设置\n * - button超过三个则纵向排列\n * - 更详细的示例请看demo\n *\n *\n * @demo #/alert\n * @usage\n *\n * import { Alert } from 'vimo'\n *\n * // Alert\n * Alert.present({\n *    title: 'Alert',\n *    message: '收到这个通知的人希望你今天能搞定这个alert组件',\n *    cssClass: 'alertCssOuterMain  ',\n *    enableBackdropDismiss: true,\n *    buttons: [\n *      {\n *        text: '确定',\n *        handler: (value) => {\n *          Alert.dismiss().then((data) => {\n *            console.debug('button3 click dismiss ')\n *            console.debug(data)\n *          });\n *        }\n *      }\n *    ]\n * });\n *\n * // Input\n * input () {\n *   Alert.present({\n *     title: '登录iTunes Store',\n *     // subTitle: '收到这个通知的人希望你今天能搞定这个alert组件',\n *     message: '请输入您Apple ID\"apple@icloud.com\"的密码',\n *     cssClass: 'alertCssOuterMain  ',\n *     enableBackdropDismiss: true,\n *     inputs: [\n *       {\n *         type: 'password',\n *         name: 'password',\n *         placeholder: '密码',\n *         value: '',\n *       },\n *     ],\n *     buttons: [\n *       {\n *         text: '取消',\n *         role: 'cancel',\n *         handler: () => {}\n *       },\n *       {\n *         text: '确定',\n *         role: '',\n *         handler: (value) => {\n *           Alert.present({\n *             title: '请确认',\n *             // subTitle: '收到这个通知的人希望你今天能搞定这个alert组件',\n *             message: '您输入的信息：' + JSON.stringify(value),\n *             cssClass: '',\n *             enableBackdropDismiss: true,\n *             buttons: [\n *               {\n *                 text: '确定',\n *                 role: 'cancel',\n *                 handler: (value) => {\n *                   Alert.dismiss().then(function (msg) {\n *                     console.log('alert input2 dismiss promise')\n *                   })\n *                 }\n *               }\n *             ]\n *           }).then(function () {\n *             console.log('alert input2 present promise')\n *           })\n *         }\n *       }\n *     ]\n *   }).then(function () {\n *     console.log('alert input1 present promise')\n *   });\n * }\n *\n */\n/**\n * @function present\n * @description\n * 开启组件, 当开启动画过度完毕时触发 `Promise` 的 `resolve` 。\n *\n * @param {object} options -

(2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n         *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n         *\n         * So what to do?  The is the best:\n         *\n         *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n         *\n         * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n         * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n         *\n         *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n         *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n         *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n         *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n         *\n         * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n         * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n         * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n         * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n         * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n         * linear speed or acceleration.\n         *\n         * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n         *\n         *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n         *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n         *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n         *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n         *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n         *\n         *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n         *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n         *     pixels!\n         *\n         *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n         *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n         *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n         *\n         * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n         *\n         *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n         *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n         *\n         *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n         *\n         *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n         *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n         *     you know.\n         *\n         * Implementation info:\n         *\n         * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n         * average mouse:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *\n         * On the trackpad:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *\n         * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n         * also missing delta values.\n         *\n         * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n         *\n         * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n         *\n         * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n         * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.

## 弹出层 / Loading组件(大Loading)\n   *\n   * Loading也有大小之分\n   *\n   * ### 关于大小Loading的问题\n   *\n   * Loading的使用场景是这样的: 当用户访问数据/资源加载/需要等待操作的需求下使用, 完整的情况下需要向用户说明我这次Loading是做什么, 比如Loading是提示\"**正在请求资源, 请稍后!**\", 有时我们并不需提示, 只需要显示菊花图即可, 因为频繁的显示大Loading还是很烦的,\n   *   这里需要介绍下Indicator组件, 他是继承Loading组件, 但是只显示菊花图, 而且调用也简单, 不必每次传入参数.\n   *\n   * ### 弹出层\n   *\n   * - Loading通过present开启, 如果没设置duration, 则需要手动dismiss,\n   * - Vimo的弹出层都是独立于页面的, 但也不是`body`的直接子元素, 而是挂载在App组件中的. 这样做是有考量的.\n   * - 组件相应路由切换, 路由切换则自动关闭\n   *\n   * ### 用法\n   *\n   * - 不传参数则显示菊花\n   * - 传入string则显示string\n   * - 参考下面的示例\n   *\n   *\n   * @props {string} [spinner='ios'] - 菊花样式\n   * @props {string} [content] - 内容\n   * @props {string} [cssClass] - 自定义样式\n   * @props {boolean} [showBackdrop=false] - 是否显示黑色背景\n   * @props {number} [duration] - loading持续时间, 如果为0则无效\n   * @props {boolean} [dismissOnPageChange=true] - 页面切换是否关闭loading\n   * @props {string} [mode='ios'] - 模式\n   *\n   * @demo #/loading\n   * @see component:Indicator\n   * @usage\n   *\n   * // 只显示菊花\n   * spinnerOnly () {\n   *      this.$loading.present();\n   *      setTimeout(() => {\n   *        this.$loading.dismiss().then(() => {\n   *
